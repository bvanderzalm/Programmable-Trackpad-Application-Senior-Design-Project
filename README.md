# Build 1.1.2 (Improvement and Bug Fixes)
Improvement
* "Start Running Macros" button now doesn't give a warning message when attempting to run it with an existing .ahk script running. (Fix: call Stop AHK before Run AHK)

* Cleaned up GUI grid and layout
* Removed Debug dropdown and debug console window on final app.exe file
* Added error popup messages on existing return checks in Create Encoder Macro Window

Bug Fixes
