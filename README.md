# Build 1.0.0
Application build used for Midterm Demo

Features
* Added ability for custom user input for macros (before it was static and now there are new windows requiring user input)
* On exit of the application your macro list is saved to a file and that file is read on initial load

The Next Step: Objectives
- Top Priority: Add separate function key and dropdowns for rotary encoders (shouldn't be too bad to implement)
- High Priority: Add ability to search, edit, and delete by (most complex out of all of the goals)
- Medium (Quality of Life Goal): On exit of the application, the dropdowns don't reflect the current AHK script running, on initial load it should pre-populate those dropdowns
- Low (Quality of Life Goal): On exit of application it should remember which appearance mode was used last so it's not defaulted to System everytime.
